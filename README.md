Remember to install [ohmyzsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh):

```
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

## Neovim

Make sure you're using a recent enough version of neovim or nvim-lsp won't be supported. Notably Debian Bookworm only packages 0.7, requiring a compile from source.

### Dependencies

- [bufferline](https://github.com/akinsho/bufferline.nvim) 
- [nvim-lsp](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig)
- [nerd fonts (git clone --depth 1; patched fira code)](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts)
